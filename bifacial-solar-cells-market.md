<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bifacial Solar Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N-Type</li><li>P-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bifacial solar cells market comprises two main types: N-type and P-type cells. N-type cells utilize phosphorus doping, resulting in higher efficiency and better performance in low-light conditions. They also exhibit reduced degradation over time. In contrast, P-type cells are doped with boron and are more widely used due to their established manufacturing processes and lower costs. However, they generally have slightly lower efficiency and higher sensitivity to light-induced degradation. Both types contribute significantly to the growing bifacial solar technology market.</p></p>
